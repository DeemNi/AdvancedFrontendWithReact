// Please, implement a function accountPatients that takes a count of beds in a hospital and returns an array of two functions:
// the first one for adding a patient
// the second one for discharging a patient
// Initially there are no patients in the hospital.
// accountPatients should keep track of free beds in a hospital and every time when a patient is admitted or discharged, print the count to the console like in examples:
// A patient was admitted, 34 beds are available
// A patient was discharged, 54 beds are available
// When there are no beds available, 
// Can not admit a patient, no beds available should be printed
// When there is an attempt to discharge a patient when there are no patients,
// There are no patients to discharge should be printed

const accountPatients = (countBeds) => {
 
    let patient = 0;

    const addingPatient = () => {
        if(patient < countBeds) {
            patient++;
            console.log(`A patient was admitted, ${countBeds - patient} beds are available`)
        } else {
            console.log('Can not admit a patient, no beds available')
        }
    }

        const dischargingPatient = () => {
            if(patient > 0) {
                patient--;
                console.log(`A patient was discharged, ${countBeds - patient} beds are available`)
        } else {
            console.log('There are no patients to discharge')
